                <p class="p4">
                In the quest for perfection with his freshly announced album, "Everything I Thought It Was," Justin Timberlake faced the daunting task<br>
                 of separating the cream of the musical crop from his overflowing stash of tunes. In a recent chat with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, <br>
                 the 42-year-old pop sensation spilled the beans on the album-making chaos. Timberlake, who clearly believes in quality over quantity,<br>
                confessed to making some tough choices, cutting down from a whopping 100 songs to a mere 18 for his eagerly awaited record, set to drop<br>
                 on March 15. With a laugh, he added, "I worked on this album for what feels like a century, and now I have the challenge of convincing you <br>
                that these 18 songs are better than the other 82 discarded masterpieces. It's like picking your favorite child, but with more bass lines and <br>
                fewer bedtime stories." Get ready for Timberlake's musical parenting skills to be put to the ultimate test!
